\chapter{Test Cases}
\label{ch:testcases}
Test Cases were developed in this study for the purpose of comparing and validating different drill string models.  The Test Cases are meant to be general and provide a reliable means of cross-checking and comparing the performances of various models, not just those specific to the current study.  As such, the key parameters, borehole design, and other information required to reproduce the Test Cases is provided.

In addition to the Test Cases themselves, the learnings from developing the Test Cases is presented.  This will both help the reader understand why the particular Test Cases were chosen and provide a methodology for developing any new cases.

\section{Recommended Procedures for Developing Test Cases}
Drill string models are complex and contain a number of parameters.  These parameters are used to make a simulation more realistic, but they are often implemented in different ways in different models.



\begin{bulletedlist}
	\item For initial model comparison, remove top drive to eliminate it as a variable
	\item Use with a vertical borehole

	\item Note how tool joints are handled: ignored, modified stiffness (equivalent stiffness), account for contact/friction?
	\item Carefully examine the units and ensure they are accurately converted
\end{bulletedlist}

When working with various friction models, it becomes vital to identify parameters that result in similar frictional behaviors.  The parameters for the friction models are static coefficient of friction, dynamic coefficient of friction, and critical velocity. Generally, the static and dynamic coefficients of friction can be equated across different models, while special attention is required to align the critical velocity with the desired frictional behavior. In the context of modeling torsional dynamics, if the critical velocities of two different models are provided in different units such as meters per second ($m/s$) and revolutions per minute ($RPM$), unit compatibility must first be established for meaningful comparison. Converting $m/s$ to $RPM$ can be achieved by \equationname~\ref{velocity_conversion}.
\begin{equation}\label{velocity_conversion}
  V=v\frac{60}{2\pi}*r_o
\end{equation}
where $V$ and $v$ are angular velocity expressed in $RPM$, and $m/s$, respectively, and $r_o$ is outer radius of the drill pipe. \wordingstart{} After matching the units, the critical angular velocity of the model, which is for the comparison, can be decided by comparing the frictional force with respect to angular velocity. \wordingend{}
%For instance, considering Test Case 2 with a critical velocity of 0.03 $m/s$ and a drill string radius of 0.075 $m$, the critical velocity can be converted to 4$RPM$.

\figurename~\ref{figure:stribeck_coulomb_friction} shows an example comparison between Coulomb and Stribeck friction models. It compares two different critical velocity of Coulomb model (4 and 10 $RPM$) with a 4 $RPM$ critical velocity for Stribeck model. In this project, we selected an angular velocity of 10 $RPM$ for the Coulomb model. This choice allows us to align the exponentially decreasing component of the Stribeck model with the static friction inherent in the Coulomb friction model. However, it is important to note that additional tests involving different angular velocities have been performed and are included in the appendix chapter for comprehensive analysis. \reviewcomment{If not added, modify}

\section{Overview of Test Cases}
In total, six Test Cases are presented. Test Cases 1 and 3 encompass scenarios involve vertical wells, with the distinction being the presence of BHA components. Similarly, Test Cases 2 and 4 are the deviated well scenarios with a 60\textdegree{} inclination angle. The difference between Test Cases 2 and 4 is the exitance of BHA components. In addition, to analyze the effect of frictional factors, Test Cases 2 and 4 are further divided into \emph{a} and \emph{b} subcases (2a, 2b, 4a, 4b). The friction factors are tested in the deviated wells because in a vertical well gravity does not create contact force (normal force). All the current Test Cases are for off-bottom scenarios. \tablename~\ref{Test_case_summary} summarizes the scenarios for each Test Case.

Additionally, the viscous damping is neglected for the simplicity of the tests in this project, but it can be included in future studies.  The tests were conducted by assuming the top drive velocity to be increased from 0 $RPM$ to 40 $RPM$ at 1 second and maintained the velocity for the rest of the time. The top drive set velocity is shown in \figurename~\ref{figure_topdrive_VSP}

\section{Terminology}
\subsection{With BHA vs Without BHA}
The Test Cases enable comparing drilling scenarios with and without the BHA components. This allows the influence of the BHA to be examined for each model by comparing the two cases.

\begin{definition}{Without BHA}
Analysis with a single drill pipe configuration to maintain simplicity and establish a baseline. This configuration represents the most straightforward drilling arrangement, with a solitary pipe running from the surface to the drill bit. In this case, the weight and diameter of the entire drill pipe are uniform and tool joints are ignored.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{With BHA}
This case is based on the Without BHA case with the notable difference that a BHA is added.  The weight and diameter of the drill pipe is are uniform, however, the BHA's distinct parameters are considered in the analysis.  Tool joints are ignored.
\end{definition}

%In the next subsection we will explore additional configurations with varying BHA designs and properties to further investigate their influence on drilling efficiency and performance. These test cases will enable us to optimize drilling operations and develop a comprehensive understanding of how the presence or absence of the BHA affects the system's behavior.

\subsection{Friction Factors}
Many drill string models take into account both static and dynamic friction between the drill string and wellbore. The friction factors (FF) will affect the drill string motion in deviated well, since the interaction between the drill string and the wellbore wall becomes complex.\wording{}  Therefore, to gain insights into the impact of friction factors on drilling dynamics, a detailed investigation is warranted.\wording{}
%but the disparity in FF values is expected to be more pronounced in inclined wells compared to vertical ones.
%This results in differing frictional forces acting on the drill string as it traverses the wellbore. As a consequence, the FF values play a crucial role in affecting the drilling performance and behavior.

\begin{definition}{Zero FF}
Tests conducted with the friction factors set to zero.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Same FF}
Tests conducted with the same value of static and dynamic friction.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Different FF}
Tests conducted with different values of static and dynamic friction.
\end{definition}




\section{Test Case 1 - Vertical Well Without BHA - Zero FF}
The model parameters and schematic of the wellbore surveys and drill string components for Test Case 1 are shown in \tablename~\ref{table_verticalwell_input} and \figurename~\ref{figure_verticalwell}. The model were tested with vertical well with MD of 2000 $m$ and bit depth of 1800 $m$. The ExxonMobil model and Matlab ver.\ A-S model uses metric units while Python ver.\ A-S model uses imperial units. For the future convenience, the tables in this chapter contains both imperial and metric units.

\section{Test Case 3 - Vertical Well with BHA - Zero FF}
In this specific scenario, an BHA components were added to the drill string. The BHA introduced extra components, resulting in an increase in both the weight and size of the drill string. However, the well survey data for the vertical well remained the same, which well design, depicted in \figurename~\ref{Vert_well_conf_BHA}, remained unchanged. The specific input parameters can be found in the \tablename~\ref{Input Parameters TC3}.
