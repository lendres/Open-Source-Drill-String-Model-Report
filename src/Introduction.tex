\chapter{Introduction}
This document was created as part of the project \emph{Research on Numerical Simulation of Downhole Drill String Dynamics}, a fundamentals research project at CNPC USA.  The project was proposed and kicked off in 2023.

The concept for a model review and evaluation resulted from conversations with members of the \osdc{} (\referencename~\cite{ref:pastusek2019a}).  A number of models have been released to the community's \emph{Github} site, however, it was not known exactly how the models compared in terms of features and performance.  At the same time, CNPC was both interested in studying drill string models and is a member of two industry-university research programs.  These programs may provide access to drilling dynamic models.  These models also need to be reviewed to determine features and investigated to determine availability.

Based on this it was decided to review the drilling dynamic models both on the \osdc{} and others that may be accessible through industry memberships.  Promising drill string models would then be selected for further evaluation and testing.

\section{Outline}
The models associated with drilling dynamics that were available on the \osdc{} Github site, as well as those potentially available through industry-university research programs were reviewed.  However, not all of these models were exercised.  Some of the models did not pertain directly to drill strings, lacked key features, or the source code was unavailable.

Two models that passed all the criteria were selected for an in-depth evaluation.  The first is the torsional model of Aarsnes-Shor.  The model has two versions available, a more mature Matlab version and a newer port to Python.  The second model is from ExxonMobil and is written in Python.  The theory and source code of both models was examined.

To compare the models, a set of Test Cases was developed.  The procedures, methods, and reasoning for selecting the Test Cases are documented.  The models were then run on the Test Cases and the results compared.  Finally, the conclusions and recommendations are reported.

\section{Objectives}
The primary motivation for CNPC USA was to evaluate soft string models.  However, in order to compare models, it is necessary to have a set of Test Cases to use as a benchmark.  In addition, well defined procedures should be used in order to allow a direction comparison.  Based on these requirements, the following objectives were adopted.
\begin{numberedlist}
	\item \emph{Review} all the models that were potential available to determine their features.
	\item \emph{Establish} a set Test Cases for comparing drill string models.
	\item \emph{Document} procedures and methods used in the comparisons.
	\item \emph{Evaluate} soft string models and assess their features and performance.
\end{numberedlist}

\section{Organization of this Document}
This document is organized in a manner that facilitates different use cases.  Together, the chapters provide a complete description of a process that starts from a model search and ends with a comparison between models.  In addition, some of the chapters are written as stand alone chapters that can be referenced independently.  Other chapters are naturally related to each other and are best read as a unit.

\chaptername~\ref{ch:modelreview} can be read as a stand alone chapter.  It contains short sections that describe each of the models that were examined.  While the models were reviewed in the context of the current project, the reviews can serve as a reference of available drilling dynamics models.

\chaptername~\ref{ch:testcases} can be read as a stand alone chapter.  The Test Cases are generalized and not specific to the particular models evaluated.  The intent is provide baseline Test Cases that can be used to compare any drill string models.  The Test Cases and procedures are defined completely within the chapter.

In \chaptername{}s~\ref{ch:aarnessshormodel},~\ref{ch:exxonmobilmodel}, and~\ref{ch:results} two different models are described in detail and compared on the Test Cases.  These chapters are best read as a unit.

\section{Important Notes on the Models}
It should be noted that these models are considered research models and are currently still in development.  As such, they were expected to lack some features a commercial code would have.  In addition, some issues were expected to be encountered.  Any potential issues reported in this document are done solely in the interest of providing feedback to the developers in hopes of helping to improve the models.  \important{At no time should any comments in this report be construed as criticisms of these models.}  On the contrary, this collaboration is viewed as demonstrating the benefits of open-source software.  A wider audience gets to make use of the software and access to the source code means issues can examined, tested, and feedback provided to the developers.

%While these models may not contain some of the features of commercial code, they capture

%The team is eternally grateful for allowing access to these models.
\section{Nomenclature}
\subsection{Steady-State and Transient Phases}
In vibration analysis, the terms \emph{transient} and \emph{steady-state} refer to the way in which the vibration of a system behaves over time.  Transient vibration is a vibration that changes over time, while steady-state vibration is a vibration that remains constant over time.

In classical mechanics and dynamics, these are well defined and understood.  Steady-state vibration refer to harmonic vibration that represents the particular part of the solution to the governing equations of motion.  The transient response is assumed to be damped out so that it has diminished to zero.

A discrete system with repeating, but non-harmonic loading, would not strictly fall into this definition.  It differs from the classical system in the steady-state phase.  The classical steady-state displays an exactly repeating pattern of behavior.  The discrete, non-harmonic system has a phase where the initial, non-repeating load has been damped out.  However, the remaining ``steady-state'' may exhibit slight differences from cycle to cycle of vibration.  \todo{Add a figure.}

However, there are obvious similarities between the classical and discrete, non-harmonic loading cases.  A clear response to machine start up and other changes in loading is evident.  Similarly, it can be seen that, given time, the systems will damp out their response to these changes. So while the classical and the discrete, non-harmonically loaded systems exhibit somewhat different traits, they are comparable in the broad sense.  As such, it is useful to speak of the two systems in the a similar manner.  \emph{Therefore, in direct analogy to classical harmonic vibration, we will refer to the transient and steady-state phases of the discrete, non-harmonic system.}

\subsection{Damping}
The governing equations of motion can be represented as
\begin{align}
    m\ddot{x}      + c_a\dot{x}      + k_ax      + f_{fric}    & = F_{ext}    \label{eq:axial_motion_GE} \\
    J\ddot{\theta} + c_t\dot{\theta} + k_t\theta + \tau_{fric} & = \tau_{ext} \label{eq:torsional_motion_GE}
\end{align}
where $m$ is mass, $c_a$ is axial damping coefficient, $k_a$ is axial stiffness, $f_{fric}$ is frictional force, $F_{ext}$ are external forces and $x$ is axial displacement, $J$ is mass moment of inertia, $c_t$ is torsional damping coefficient, $k_t$ is torsional stiffness, $\tau_{fric}$ is frictional torque, $\tau_{ext}$ is external torque and $\theta$ is angular displacement.  \equationname~\ref{eq:axial_motion_GE} is the equation for linear motion and \equationname~\ref{eq:torsional_motion_GE} is the analogous equation for rotational motion.
 
In this project, frictional force, $f_{fric}$, and frictional torque, $\tau_{fric}$, are defined as a force resisting the relative motion of elements sliding against each other.  It should be noted that this is the only constraint on the definition.  For example, the frictional force may or may not have a rate dependent component.  For drill string dynamics, the primarily source of friction is from drill string and wellbore contact.

%This type of friction is a function of the friction factor and normal force at the point of contact.

The terms $c_a\dot{x}$ and $c_t\dot{\theta}$, are referred to as viscous damping forces.  For drill string dynamics, this is primarily drag that results from drilling mud and cuttings.

Both friction and viscous damping are types of damping, which is a more general term referring to forces that remove energy from the system.

These definitions are provided to clarify how these terms are used \emph{in this document}.  Other sources may define them differently, use terms such as ``viscous friction'' not used here, or use a different name for the same concepts.

\subsection{Models}
\subsubsection{Static and Dynamic}
Models can be classified as either static or dynamic.  Static models do not account for acceleration (\staticforcebalance{}).  Dynamic models account for inertia (\dynamicforcebalance{}).  Within each of these categories, there are a variety of types of models (single body/multibody, rigid body/flexible, et cetera).  Particularly for dynamics models, there is a broad range of fidelities (or complexity).  The authors did not feel the compulsion to name or classify each of these types of dynamics models.  Rather, a simpler, more straightforward approach is taken and the features of each model reviewed are described.

\subsubsection{Steady-State and Transient Models}
``Steady-state model'' is a synonym for ``static model.'' The phrase ``transient model'' is sometimes used to mean a dynamic model that can capture transient phases.  The authors prefer the terms ``static'' and ``dynamic'' models.  Partially because they are more approachable and easier to understand.  But also as a way to prevent confusion.  The terms ``steady-state'' and ``transient'' will be reserved for the steady-state and transient \emph{phases} of a dynamic response.

\subsection{Review and Evaluation}
In this document we will use the term ``review'' in context of a model to mean a literature review and assessment of the features of the model.  The term ``evaluation'' will be used to mean the model was executed, run, tested on standardized cases, and compared to other models.
