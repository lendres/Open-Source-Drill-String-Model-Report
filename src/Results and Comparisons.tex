\section{Test Case 1}
Test Case 1 represents a scenario with vertical well without BHA components. The results for Test Case 1 in each model are depicted in \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase1}. Both models exhibited similar outcomes, revealing a fundamental vibration frequency of 0.440 $Hz$ and 0.427 $Hz$ from the A-S model and the ExxonMobil model, respectively. The maximum bit velocity was at 79 $RPM$ for the A-S model and 81 $RPM$ for the ExxonMobil model. Also, the torque on the top drive was predicted as 1762 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the A-S model and 1814 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the ExxonMobil model. The comparisons between the results from different models are illustrated in \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase1_overlapped} and summarized in \tablename~\ref{table_summary_testcase1}. Although both models exhibited similar frequencies, the minimal frequency differences contribute to the observed shift between the two models.

\section{Test Case 2}
Test Case 2 simulates a deviated well scenario without BHA components. In Test Case 2a, both the static and dynamic friction factors are set to 0.5. Test Case 2b uses a static friction factor of 0.5 and a dynamic friction factor of 0.25.

\subsection{Test Case 2a}
The results for Test Case 2a from each model are depicted in \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase2_1}. Similar to Test Case 1, both models are well matched with fundamental vibration frequencies of 0.283 $Hz$ and 0.272 $Hz$ for the A-S model and the ExxonMobil model, respectively. The maximum bit velocity was at 78 $RPM$ for the A-S model and 79 $RPM$ for the ExxonMobil model, while the maximum torque on the top drive was predicted as 6643 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the A-S model and 6891 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the ExxonMobil model. \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase2_1_overlapped} illustrates the comparison of the results from two different models and the features are summarized in \tablename~\ref{table_summary_testcase2a}.

\subsection{Test Case 2b}
The results for Test Case 2b from each model are depicted in \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase2_2}. The stick-slip behavior during drilling was observed in both models. Both models showed transient behavior until 40 seconds and showed almost consistent patterns of vibration after 40 seconds. The period of the stick phase steadily increased from the beginning and reached about 1.75 seconds for the A-S model and 1.78 seconds for the ExxonMobil model. This stick-slip event was caused by friction in the deviated well.  The effect of the dynamic friction factor---the only variable changed---can be seen by comparing Test Cases 2a and 2b. Both models showed a spike in bit angular velocity which goes below zero. This was not investigated and it is recommended that the cause be explored in future studies. Both models showed very similar responses, especially in the transient duration (before 40 seconds).

The fundamental frequencies of the vibration were 0.280 $Hz$ and 0.269 $Hz$ for the A-S model and the ExxonMobil model, respectively.  These are similar to Test Case 2a. The maximum bit velocity was at 107 $RPM$ for the A-S model and 116 $RPM$ for the ExxonMobil model. The maximum torque on the top drive was predicted as 5185 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the A-S model and 5540 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the ExxonMobil model and occurred at the first cycle for both cases. \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase2_2_overlapped} illustrates the comparison of the results from two different models during 60 seconds of modeling. Relatively similar behavior can be seen from the comparison and also the effect of the phase shift was observed. The comparison of the features from each model's result is shown in \tablename~\ref{table_summary_testcase2b}.

The difference in frequency is small, but the accumulated effect of these differences caused the phase shift during 60 seconds. Overall, both models matched well. The transient phase (before 40 seconds) showed similar vibration patterns for both models. Both models predicted a similar standstill duration of 1.6-1.8 seconds during the stick phase (after 40 seconds).

\section{Test Case 3}
 Test Case 3 represents the scenario of a vertical well with BHA components. The results show similarities with Test Case 1 (vertical well without BHA components), but fluctuations in the peak values of the vibration for both bit angular velocity and top drive torque were observed. Specifically, the peak value decreases until 80 seconds and then starts to increase again, returning to the peak value at 120 seconds. \figurename{}s~\ref{figure_testcase3} and~\ref{figure_testcase3_overlapped} illustrate the results for each model and comparisons for Test Case 3. \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase3_overlapped} shows the simulation results for a longer time length (120 seconds) to clearly show the change in the peak values. The results of each model are summarized in \tablename~\ref{table_summary_testcase3}

Compared to Test Case 1 (without BHA components), the fundamental vibration frequencies in Test Case 3 were slightly decreased to 0.420 $Hz$ for the A-S model and 0.408 $Hz$ for the ExxonMobil model. Conversely, the bit velocity and torque on the top drive increased. The maximum bit velocity was 80 $RPM$ for the A-S model and 81 $RPM$ for the ExxonMobil model, while the torque on the top drive was predicted as 1844 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the A-S model and 1841 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ for the ExxonMobil model.

\section{Test Case 4}
Test Case 4 simulates a deviated well scenario with BHA components. In Test Case 4a, both the static and dynamic friction factors are set to 0.5 while Test Case 4b uses a static friction factor of 0.5 and a dynamic friction factor of 0.25.

\subsection{Test Case 4a}
Results for Test Case 4a for each model and the comparison between the two models are depicted in \figurename{}s~\ref{figure_testcase4_1} and~\ref{figure_testCase4_1_overlapped}, respectively. The features are summarized in \tablename~\ref{table_summary_testcase4a}. It can be seen that the effect of the BHA components are more significant in a deviated well as compared to a vertical well by comparing Test Cases 1 and 3 (vertical) with Test Cases 2a and 4a (deviated). The maximum top drive torque increased by about 1500 $lb\mbox{-}ft$ when adding the BHA components to the drill string, while the bit angular velocity was almost the same. The significant effect of \reviewcomment{increased what? Torque?}\resolvedcomment{} BHA components on top drive torque in deviated well  compared to vertical well can be the result of increased depth, increased friction. However, The shear modulus between Test Cases 2a,4a and Test Cases 1,3 are different and this difference in shear modulus might also affected the effect of BHA component in top drive torque \reviewcomment{How does shear modulus increase the torque?}\resolvedcomment{} (refer to input parameters in \chaptername~\ref{ch:testcases}). Additional sensitivity tests can be conducted to analyze the effect of BHA components on drill string vibration.

\subsection{Test Case 4b}
The comparison between the A-S and ExxonMobil models are illustrated in \figurename~\ref{figure_testcase4_2_overlapped} and the features are summarized in \tablename~\ref{table_summary_testcase4b}.
Except the shift in the phase that gradually occurred over the 60 seconds modeled, both models matched in overall behavior. They both demonstrated stick-slip with similar characteristics.

The effect of BHA components in deviated well is more detailed in \figurename{}s~\ref{figure_BHA_Matlab} and~\ref{figure_BHA_EXXON} from the A-S and the ExxonMobil model, respectively. Adding the BHA slowed down the vibration while increased the torque on top drive. Specifically, the spikes on top drive were observed in both models before the stick phase. These sudden spikes were more significant in the A-S model.

\section{Conclusions}
\reviewcomment{Still working on}
In this project, we introduce simple but well-structured test cases and compared two different models, A-S and ExxonMobil model. This marks the initial phase in establishing a systematic workflow for evaluating drill string models, enhancing the reliability of any existing or newly developed models. 

Total four Test Cases were provided which are vertical well with and without BHA components, deviated well with and without BHA components. In addition scenario with different dynamic friction factors were also included in the Test Cases. We initiate our test case with a vertical well with a simple drill string configuration that enables the assessment of the models without the influence of friction and BHA components. The Test Cases gradually increase in complexity by adding friction effect and BHA components. Incrementally adding complexity in Test Cases allowed understanding and unrevealing the potential causes of variations between the different model's results. 

Below summarizes the lessons and findings from model comparisons between A-S and ExxonMobil model based on suggested Test Cases.
\begin{bulletedlist}
    \item Accurate unit conversions are essential when comparing different models. 
    \item Comprehensive understanding of the meaning of each parameter is necessary. for example A-S and ExxonMobil model applies different friction model, therefore, finding proper critical velocity for each model that results in similar behavior of the drill string is required.
    \item To ensure a model comparison or evaluation, it is important to eliminate any factors causing different results. For example ExxonMobil model is able to model the tool joint, while A-S does not. Therefore, removing the tool-joint effect is necessary.
    \item Implementing a PI controller in simulations led to a decay in vibration amplitude. PI controller acts as a damping to the system which was observed in A-S model. Removing the PI controller enables us to obtain a model with reduced parameters and eliminates the damping effect from the PI controller which has advantage in model comparison. Also, similar results were obtained between ExxonMobil model and A-S model by removing the PI controller. However, a more accurate results from the field can be obtained by enabling the PI controller.
    \item A-S model and ExxonMobil model showed very similar results, but showed differences in vibration frequencies. The difference was still available without friction, viscous damping and BHA components. So more focus on simple vertical well test is required to find the causation of the frequency differences.
    \item Overall the model matched very well on both transient and steady state phase. 
\end{bulletedlist}

The availability of well-structured Test Cases, as introduced in this project, allows for rigorous comparison and verification of drill string models, This enables researchers and engineers to assess their model's accuracy and performance in various scenarios. The data and findings obtained from these Test Cases offer valuable insights and constitute a substantial contribution to the field of drill string modeling and simulation. As a result, this study serves as a valuable reference for further research and development in the domain of drilling engineering and related disciplines.
